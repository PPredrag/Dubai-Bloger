			<h4><b>How to Conceive a Boy or a Girl?</b></h4></br>
			<img src="../images/bg3.jpg">
			With the recent scientific development and the researches, it is very much possible to choose the gender of your baby naturally, and I have seen many couples doing so successfully nowadays. As per the scientific findings, it is established: Sperms carrying Y Chromosomes – Male sperms are smaller and lighter, therefore faster and agiler than the sperms carrying X chromosomes. They do not have thick protection and hence die quicker than the ones carrying X chromosomes. Sperms carrying X Chromosomes – Female sperms are bigger, slower and they have a thicker protective membrane so they can survive longer than the sperms carrying Y chromosomes. So…

			<h4>If you want a baby GIRL</h4></br>
			1.	Conception must happen three or four days before ovulation</br>
			2.	Keep penetration shallow</br>
			3.	Man should reach orgasm first</br>
			4.	Do not have unprotected sex for the next 10 days</br>
			5.	She must consume plenty of milk and dairy products (yogurt, cheese, ice-cream…)</br></br></br>
			<h4>If you want a baby BOY</h4></br>
			1.	Conception must happen on the day of ovulation</br>
			2.	Do not have seven days before the target date</br>
			3.	Woman to reach orgasm before the partner.</br>
			4.	Choose a position which allows deeper penetration (doggy style suggested)</br>
			5.	She is on alkaline rich diet – to consume more red meat, fruits, vegetables,
			mushrooms, nuts…and avoid milk and dairy products (yogurt, cheese, ice-cream…)</br></br>
			In order to CONCEIVE A BOY, you need to have intercourse exactly on the day of
			ovulation, as close as possible to the moment when the egg has been released
			from the ovary.</br> Maximum 24 hours before that moment and 12 hours afterward
			would also give the male sperms a head start. You just need to make sure the
			timing is right and leave the rest to nature and logic – out of millions of
			sperm seeds, must be that the fastest one will reach the egg first. And it
			will be the one starting a life of your desirable baby boy to be.
			So, at the beginning, you need to Define the ovulation date and be
			absolutely sure about the same.</br></br><img src="../images/bg2.jpg"></br></br> Since basal body temperature
			increases at the time of ovulation you need to keep the check on it at
			least 2 months prior to conception. Measure the temperature everyday
			morning before getting up from the bed and keep the record.
			It’s better to use a basal thermometer, which is more exact to a regular one.
			The day ovulation occurs you should notice a sudden jump in
			temperature from the normal baseline. This confirms the ovulation.
			Still, to be 100 % certain, you should also use some of the medicinal kits.
			Nowadays various ovulation predictor sets are available widely in
			the market at grocery and drug stores.
			Second to be checked is High sperm count.</br></br>
			This is a must because male sperms are not as strong as female ones, and so the higher the count is, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first.
			To keep the sperm count high couples supposed to abstain for a week before conception and then only make it once on a predetermined day.
			Choose the Intercourse position carefully.
			The idea is to deposit the sperm as close as possible to the entry of
			cervix so that the Y sperms have to cover a less distance. I
			guess you have an idea of what I am talking about.
			Have an orgasm ladies! A little big O never hurt nobody!
			Plus, it’s highly recommended to give a head start to the Y sperms.
			It was recently found that the male sperms prefer alkaline environments
			and during the orgasm female body releases an alkaline fluid, which is
			much more male-sperm friendly than the natural acidity that all women have.
			To increase the alkalinity, medical experts advise mothers to be to
			Have an alkali-rich diet. This is to maintain a high pH level in your
			body which helps the Y sperms to stay alive much longer and swim faster.
			Eat foods like banana, sweet corn, sausages, red meat, fresh fruits low in sugar,
			soybeans… and avoid foods containing too much magnesium and calcium like
			milk and dairy products, dark chocolate, sweets, raw spinach… Furthermore,
			breakfast is highly recommended so no skipping the same.</br></br></br><img src="../images/bg5.jpg"></br></br>
			At the end, please note, the conceiving method I am sharing here is
			natural and completely safe with no health risks involved. Every single
			fact mentioned above is accurate and scientifically proven, but still,
			you need to know the result may not be 100%. If the procedure
			is properly applied the chances and success rate comes about 96 percent.</br></br>
