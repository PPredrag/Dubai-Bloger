		<h4><b>Start planning your Dubai vacation immediately with these hot tips</b></h4></br>
		Dubai is the city of extravagance—bigger, better, faster, stronger. With the help of local blogger/influencer Dragana Radosavljevic, we give you five things that should be on your radar for your
		next Dubai trip, through the influential eyes of a local.</br></br>
		<img src="../images/d11.jpg" class="bg"></br></br></br>
		Dragana Radosavljevic, who goes by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dubaiblogger/" target="_blank">@dubaiblogger</a> on her Instagram page
		and dragana.net on her lifestyle blog, is a Serbian journalist that has
		lived in Dubai since 2010. With almost 100 thousand Instagram followers, she works as a social media influencer, public relations specialist, and political scientist. She loves the United Arab Emirates’ biggest and most glamorous city for its endless opportunities for exploration for both locals and tourists seeking a Dubai vacation: “Anything you can think of,
		you can do in Dubai,” she says. Here are her top picks for the city.</br></br></br>

		<b>Explore the Architecture</b></br>
		Burj Khalifa in DubaiA recent study by Sony Mobile and OnePoll
		listed the world’s 30 most photographed landmarks. While Paris’
		Eiffel Tower topped the list, with London’s Big Ben in second place,
		two Dubai skyscrapers were also ranked highly: Burj Khalifa
		(5th most photographed), and Burj Al Arab (18th most photographed).
		“Dubai always wants to have the biggest, the best,
		the most expensive, and the most amazing,” Dragana says.
		Burj Khalifa has been the world’s tallest building since
		2008. It was built to be the centerpiece of Downtown Dubai
		and with the intention of making the city a more attractive
		tourist destination. Head up the highest elevator in the world
		and get off on the 148th-floor observation deck for an incredible
		panoramic view of Dubai. For another typically showy Dubai
		building, check out the luxury hotel Burj Al Arab, the
		third-largest hotel in the world. Its outline resembles
		the sail of a ship, and it sits on an artificial island,
		only accessible by bridge. Finally, the Ain Dubai is a
		massive Ferris wheel that, once completed in 2018, will
		carry 1,400 passengers, offer undisturbed views of the
		skyline, and will be fully air-conditioned. In typical Dubai
		fashion, the Ain was built specifically to stake claim as
		the world’s largest Ferris wheel, overtaking the London
		Eye—it was originally called Dubai Eye—and the current leader,
		High Roller in Las Vegas.</br></br></br>
		<b>Shopping</b></br></br>
		The Dubai MallAfter your visit to the Burj Khalifa,
		head across the street to one of Dubai’s top attractions,
		The Dubai Mall. Stop us if you’ve heard something
		like this in the last few paragraphs, but The Dubai
		Mall is the world’s largest mall (did we mention Dubai
		likes things big?). Along with 1,200 shops—including the
		world’s largest sweet shop—the mall is home to an
		ice rink, and children’s amusement center, and an
		aquarium. As far as actual shopping is concerned,
		you’re in good hands here. Looking for high-end brands?
		Radosavljevic explains, “Anything you can find in Milan,
		New York, or Paris, you can find at The Dubai Mall.”
		Street fashion brands popular in American like H&M and
		Guess are also found easily, and sales happen frequently.
		The mother of all shopping events is Dubai Shopping Festival.
		The annual month-long event spans December and January
		and chops prices as much as 90%, so shoppers, plan your
		vacation to Dubai accordingly.</br></br></br>
		<b>The Nightlife</b></br></br>
		Dubai at nightDubai might not be immediately synonymous with
		nightlife, but for those in the know, the party scene is
		legendary. Thursday and Friday nights (Dubai’s weekend is
		Friday and Saturday) are vibrant at many of the city’s bars
		and nightclubs, often located in hotels (to get around the
		strict alcohol laws), and Tuesday is a popular ladies’ night.
		Dragana says of Dubai’s nightlife: “It’s incredible that you
		can go to one place and meet people from so many different nations.
		Everyone brings something special from their country and
		culture, so the mix can be quite amazing. But it’s not necessarily
		about one particular nightclub; it’s about the people—both
		locals and tourists.” It’s also about the high-profile North
		American names that frequently pop up at Dubai’s extravagant
		nightclubs. If you show up on the right night, you could easily
		encounter performers like Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, and Chris Brown,
		or DJs like David Guetta and Martin Garrix. While the UAE has a pretty
		strict dress code, Dubai is relatively liberal, and when it comes to
		the swankiest of nightclubs, typical clubbing attire like short
		skirts are commonplace. Don’t plan a Dubai vacation without
		thinking about its energetic nightlife, but be sensible about
		where and when you drink and make sure you respect local laws
		and customs.</br></br></br>
		<b>Desert Safari</b></br></br>
		Desert safari in DubaiOne of the best ways to get a
		taste of Arabic culture while in UAE is by taking part
		in a desert safari. Start with dune bashing—where a
		skilled driver takes you on a thrilling 4×4 ride across
		wide open sand dunes. Then try your hand at some sandboarding,
		which is a desert take on snowboarding. Other stops along the
		way could include visiting a camel farm for a desert ride or
		stopping for traditional henna tattoos. Your tour typically
		ends with a live show—belly dance, tanoura dance, or fire
		show—and dinner.
		Pro Tip: Couples should try the romantic VIP midnight safari
		for two which includes a dinner of traditional Arabian cuisine
		under the stars. “If you only have one day to spend in Dubai,
		you should try the desert safari,” Radosavljevic says.</br></br></br>

		<b>The Palm Jumeirah</b></br>
		Many of Luxury Retreats’ new high-end villa offerings in
		Dubai can be found at the Palm Jumeirah. The artificial,
		tree-shaped island is one of Dubai’s top attractions, but
		for those lucky enough to afford it, the Palm can be more
		than just a passing diversion; it can be home. The largest
		man-made island in the world (last time, we promise), has a
		“trunk” that’s more than a mile long and 16 “fronds”
		(the tree’s leaves) each lined with luxury beachfront villas.
		Stay on the crescent for views of the Arabian Gulf, or on the
		fronds for serene beachfront privacy. The surrounding crescent
		features a waterpark, a nightclub, and luxury hotels. The best
		way to see the Palm is by hopping on the 2,400-passenger monorail
		that tours the development end to end in about 10 minutes.
		Celebrities that have reportedly owned homes on Palm Jumeirah
		include soccer star David Beckham, Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan,
		and former basketball star Michael Jordan, so you’ll be in good company.</br></br></br>
