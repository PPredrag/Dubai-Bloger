      <h2><b>Eva Maria Cosmetics!</b> </h2></br></br>
      This blog review is more of the way to express my pleasure and satisfaction of being a Brand Ambassador
	  for a virtuous skincare brand that’s hot to the market, Eva Maria Cosmetics! I feel truly grateful for 
	  the trust they've placed in me, looking forward to achieving and celebrating new levels of our success 
	  over the coming years.</br></br></br><img src="../images/draganaRadosavljevic.jpeg" alt=""></br></br>
	However, when choosing to be a brand rep for a company, I base it on an ultimate belief of really loving the 
	products. And this between me and Eva was the love at first test! The company itself took my breath away, as I 
	truly feel and respect the ethics and the entire vision behind the brand. Every product line of Eva Maria Cosmetics’
	carries a strong message of humanity, kindness, good vibes, synergy, love, happiness, victory, and success. 
	Those arguments made me feel identified with them. This is where our common strength lies. </br></br>
 </br></br><img src="../images/dubaiBlogger.jpeg" alt="tri1"></br></br>
	Eva Maria Cosmetics is gorgeously natural, bespoke and ethical skincare brand that stands behind 
	the pure natural and organic products, made freshly in Croatia, one of the ecologically best-preserved
	 parts of Europe. Every drop of their face and body oils and milk cremes contains exclusively natural
	 plant substances and compounds, with 0% parabens, silicone, artificial colors, synthetic fragrance or 
	 mineral oils. Plus, what I like the most - they smell delicious! They are completely also Vegan and
	 Vegetarian-friendly and environmentally conscious. Also, not tested on animals. The product range focuses 
	 on the following categories - Face, Body, Massage and Fun, Anti Ageing and Maternity. I have tried
	 and tested all of them, remained impressed particularly by “Password Rich”, the luxurious, stylish 
	and erotic collection, inspired by high-end successful and charismatic individuals and their luxurious “over the edge” lifestyle. </br></br>
	 	 </br></br><img src="../images/dragana.jpeg" alt="tri1"></br></br>
	As they say - the finest fresh ingredients thoughtfully mixed and bottled up in a sophisticated style.
	 The packaging itself is another story! A fairy-tale actually! The bottles look so sweet and charming,
	 designed to be a nice, stylish detail in our bathrooms and living areas, as well as the beautiful gift
	 for our loved ones. It really feels ultra special to receive one of those adorable little packages. </br></br></br>
	Moreover, not only Eva Maria Cosmetics is a lovely brand in many ways, really kind to communicate with
	 and genuinely care about their customers, they are also a charitable group, donating a percentage of 
	 every product sold to the various community causes and organizations. “The Bottles of Kindness” is their latest 
	 charitable project that makes me so proud to be a part of. We, as a team love a worthy cause and like 
	 to be involved in as many causes as we can. We strongly believe in our good cause, in ourselves 
	 as human beings, in our products, as you will too when you try them on your own skin. </br></br>
