   <p class="slovoP">To be honest, radosavljevics.com supposed to be a glossy lifestyle blog at first. I tried to create something like that, but then I remembered I am a professional journalist, a business owner, a half-time social media person as per that business’ requirement and a full-time mother of two and a wife of a one… not the simple one! So, Instead, I created the story of a sweet yet chaotic, fun packed family life, happens to be rolling in the luxury of Dubai.</p>

         <p class="slovoP">Looking at all these young Bloggers & 
		 Instagrammers I’m like – Man, they have so much time! But
		 truth be told, I wouldn’t trade my super crazy family days for anything. So here we are. Right in front of this simple and honest life story of four ordinary people: a mother, a father, a sister and a brother that all together make something very cool and extraordinary indeed, the family.
          Did you know your family is essential to your well-being? 
		  Giving and receiving love and empathy and spending quality 
		  time together improves the likelihood the family members 
		  will stay healthy. However, it doesn’t take too much insight to, 
		  unfortunately, realise that families today look much different 
		  from the way they did just a decade ago. The idyllic picture of
		  mum, dad, and two children living happily in the beautiful home 
		  is just not as likely nowadays.</p>
