   <h1>Real Cost Of Living in Dubai</h1>
      <p>The new survey compares the cost of living in <b>Dubai, New York and London,</b>
	  and the results are quite surprising. Yes, we all know the rents are crazy here, 
	  and yes the Carrefour bill is always higher than expected, but contrary to
	  what you may think about living in Dubai, it is not the most expensive city to live in.
	  According to Savills latest Live/Work Index, which measures the combined cost of 
	  residential and office rental per person per year across leading world class cities, the cost of
	  accommodating an employee in London and New York is more than double that of Dubai.

      <p>It’s certainly not a cheap decision to live in the heart
		of a popular city, or even the surrounding areas for that matter. 
		However, high rent is a top issue in Dubai, but comparing to the 
		UK and USA big cities you must consider the extras that often come
		with a Dubai apartment – pool, gym, security, and sometimes more – as well as London an New York 
		properties traditionally being smaller and older, Dubai’s 
		rental market looks rather attractive.</br>
		<b>Soho, London</b> – Dhs164,000 per year
		It gets you: 776 sq ft / 2 bed / 2 bath / communal gardens / 24h concierge.</br>
		<b>Downtown Dubai</b> – Dhs150,000 per year
		It gets you: 1,356 sq ft / 2 bed / 3 bath / balcony / swimming pool / gym / security.</br>
		<b>Upper East Side, New York</b> – Dhs220,156 per year
		It gets you: 1,025 sq ft / 2 bed / 2 bath / 24h concierge.<br>

      <p>It’s difficult to argue against either city when it comes 
	  to the quality of the food, with a diverse selection of 
	  cuisines from all over the world, served in both casual
	  and high-end restaurants, widely available in each city.
		<hr>
		Restaurant Prices in New York, NY are 56% <b>higher</b> than in Dubai
		<hr>
		Groceries Prices in New York are about 69% <b>higher</b> than in Duba

		Local Purchasing Power in New York is 23% <b>lower</b> than in Dubai
		<hr>
		Restaurant Prices in London are about 55% <b>higher</b> than in Dubai

		Groceries Prices in London are about 18% <b>higher</b> than in Dubai

	 <img class="slika100" src="../images/cost6.jpg" alt="">Another way we can compare them, however, is the 
	 price of the groceries, and again it looks like Dubai offers the best value.
	 Most of us know how cheap petrol is in Dubai – the cost of a taxi ride is as cheap as a bus ride in the UK. That’s what you get for living in a petroleum producing country . Until recently, petrol prices were heavily subsidised by the government, and the price is now on the up. It’s nothing to get too upset about,
	 though, as you can see below, we’re still far cheaper than our Western friends.<br/><br/><br/>
	 <hr>
	 London : Dhs5.45 per litre.
	 <hr>
	 New York : Dhs7.68 per litre.
	 <hr>
	 Dubai : Dhs1.92 per litre.
	 <br/>
	 
	 <img class="slika100" src="../images/cost7.jpg" alt="">
	 So, keep calm Dubai peoples, London is the one officially listed as the most expensive
	 place in the World, with the average living and work accommodation costs coming
	 in at around 415k dhs per year,with New York following closely in second place at 
	 409k dhs. Dubai is in 10th place, costing around 215k dhs on average per year.
     Expats in Dubai still claim today that they’re only in the country to earn a 
	 tax-free salary. In the UK, people with a monthly income less than 15k dhs must 
	 pay 20% tax on their income. Those who earn between that amount and 70,765 dhs 
	 must pay a 40% tax, and those who earn more pays 45%.<br/><br/><br/>
	 <hr>
	 Average Monthly Salary (Net After Tax)
	 <hr>
	 New York:  13,030 AED
	 <hr>
	 Dubai:   12,343 AED
	 <hr>
	  London: 10,749 AED
